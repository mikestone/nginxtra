* Hope you are all having a great RailsConf!

SLIDE
* I have been having a great time, perhaps stayed up a little too late gaming
  So I probably didn't prepare as much as I should have
  So feel free to check twitter right now

SLIDE
* What is nginxtra and why should I use it?

SLIDE
* Let's look at github...

SLIDE
* Shoot....

SLIDE
* Sorry Farrah!  I'll try to fix this soon...

SLIDE
* Ok, well, good thing I wrote the code, so I can describe it for you now.
  But first... what is nginx?
  It is an efficient web server that compiles all modules in
  rather than link them in, like Apache does

SLIDE /ruby versions match to nginx versions
* nginxtra is a gem that wraps the source code of nginx
  So you can keep nginx up to date

SLIDE /but wait there's more!
* But it's more.

SLIDE
* You get a Ruby DSL to configure nginx

SLIDE
* The configuration can indicate what compilation options to enable nginx

SLIDE
* You can break out code into logical partials

SLIDE
* You can install, start, stop and view the status of nginx
